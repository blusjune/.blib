OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow.

OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1518,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1519,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1522,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1523,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1527,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1528,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it.

OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1532,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1533,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1534,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1537,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1538,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1539,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1540,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8');

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1545,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1546,'<!--\nhttp://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n-->\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

Under the terms of the agreement, SanDisk will pay approximately $327 million in cash and provide certain equity-based incentives. Pliant Technology offers SSDs that integrate into enterprise information systems. The company has approximately 80 employees and is based in Milpitas, California. The company raised over $50 million since its founding in 2006.</ref>\n|-\n| 2011-04-20 || STEC || KQ Infotech || ?? || sTec은 system SW 개발 및 가상화 기술 역량 강화를 위해 KQ Infotech의 핵심 멤버 30명을 흡수. <ref>[http://www.storagenewsletter.com/news/business/stec-acquires-assets-of-kq-infotech Stec Acquires Assets of KQ Infotech (2011-04-20)] <br/>The portfolio of acquired assets includes KQI\'s intellectual property rights. In addition, STEC has hired approximately 30 key employees of KQI to augment its existing software development team. The financial terms of this transaction are not disclosed. \"The team of skilled software engineers from KQI has significant experience in such areas as \'\'\'system software development and virtualization\'\'\',\" said CEO of sTec.</ref>\n|-\n| 2011-03 || OCZ || Indilinx || NAND Flash Controllers || OCZ는 SandForce Controller의 Retail/Channel로 역할을 하고 있었지만, SandForce는  OCZ 뿐만 아니라 OCZ의 경쟁자들에게도 Controller를 판매하고 있었음. 이에 대한 위기 의식으로, 이전부터 밀접한 관계를 가져오던 Indilinx를 인수한 것으로 보이며, 이로 인해 OCZ는 SandForce SSD Controller 의존도를 낮추고 자립성을 높일 수 있게 됨. <ref>[http://www.anandtech.com/show/4220/ocz-grows-up-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-indilinx OCZ Grows Up, Signs Definitive Agreement to Acquire Indilinx (2011-03-14)]<br/>Why would OCZ acquire Indilinx? To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1547,'\n\n== ## bNote-2013-09-13 ==\n\n=== Flash Memory Summit 2013 ===\n* [[Industry Intelligence - Flash Memory Summit 2013]]\n\n\n== ## bNote-2013-09-12 ==\n\n* [[Industry intelligence]]\n\n== ## bNote-2013-09-11 ==\n\n* http://admission.snu.ac.kr/graduate\n: 지원서 접수 마감: 2013-10-18 18:00 \n: TOEFL (CBT / IBT / PBT : 227 / 86 / 567)\n\n* [[Workload analysis-driven system architecture design]]\n\n== ## bNote-2013-09-10 ==\n\n=== Preparing Talk 2013-09-11 ===\n\n* SHOULD get focused!!!\n: separate topics to be discussed from topics to hide (no need to mention)\n\n* Research goal\n: Devise distinguished approaches which leads to the fundamental change in the\ndistributed computing paradigm\n\n* History and future direction based on the map of \'time/area axes\'\n:- to show the direction and motivation\n:- to reveal all the topics connected organically\n:- to reveal the real capability (programming, patents, papers, ...)\n\n* Capability: programming\n:- R, Python, and shell for analysis (esp. list familiar R packages)\n::- R statistical computing framework (frequent itemset mining, association rules mining, HMM, neuralnet)\n:- C and Assembly reading for kernel development\n::- Fusion IO VSL (virtualized storage layer) analysis\n\n* Capability: standardization experience\n:- LiMo Security TF: SPEF (Security policy enforcement framework) with Motorola\n:- Good technical communication\n\n* Patents portfolio\n:- List up all the patents to reveal the technical experience\n:- Strategic patents\n\n* Paper portfolio\n:- List up all the papers to reveal the technical experience\n\n* Study plan - Virtualization, Hadoop, ARM, Workload Analysis\n: Green computing\n: Profiling\n: Bottleneck analysis\n\n\n=== Note ===\n\n----\n\n* VDI VM data backup\n\n* VDI VM access (F:)\n: \\\\75.1.240.249\\SAIT$\\brian.m.jung\n:: Microsoft Windows Network\n\n* VDI VM access (R:)\n: \\\\75.1.240.244\\sharesait72$\n:: Microsoft Windows Network\n\n <pre>\n\n# Architect // 3.27 GB\n# atlas // 13.9 GB\n# FutureOS // 6.35 GB\n~ gto // 7.11 GB\n~ Multicore // 7.27 GB\nosv // 64.9 GB\nosv/__SW_Mobility // 29.4 GB\nosv_sds // 16.0 GB\nse기획_ok // 24.8 GB\nStorage // \n~ swgto // 3.60 GB\n~ sw역량강화 // 2.27 GB\n~ 인적역량wg // 0.0503 GB\n\n</pre>\n\n* VDI VM access (--)\n: \\\\168.219.177.80\\종기원\n:: Microsoft Windows Network\n\n\n----\n\n연락처, 전화번호\n구본철 010-9190-5907 01091905907\n신현정 017-324-9294 0173249294\n\n----\n\n== ## bNote-2013-09-09 ==\n\n=== Micro server ===\n\n* http://armservers.com/2012/11/16/whats-a-little-core-like-arm-doing-in-a-place-like-this/#more-452\n\n* SeaMicro Vs.
