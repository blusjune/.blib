OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow.

OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1518,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1519,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1522,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1523,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1527,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1528,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it.

OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1532,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1533,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1534,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1537,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1538,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1539,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1540,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8');

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1545,'http://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1546,'<!--\nhttp://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n-->\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

Under the terms of the agreement, SanDisk will pay approximately $327 million in cash and provide certain equity-based incentives. Pliant Technology offers SSDs that integrate into enterprise information systems. The company has approximately 80 employees and is based in Milpitas, California. The company raised over $50 million since its founding in 2006.</ref>\n|-\n| 2011-04-20 || STEC || KQ Infotech || ?? || sTec은 system SW 개발 및 가상화 기술 역량 강화를 위해 KQ Infotech의 핵심 멤버 30명을 흡수. <ref>[http://www.storagenewsletter.com/news/business/stec-acquires-assets-of-kq-infotech Stec Acquires Assets of KQ Infotech (2011-04-20)] <br/>The portfolio of acquired assets includes KQI\'s intellectual property rights. In addition, STEC has hired approximately 30 key employees of KQI to augment its existing software development team.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1547,'\n\n== ## bNote-2013-09-13 ==\n\n=== Flash Memory Summit 2013 ===\n* [[Industry Intelligence - Flash Memory Summit 2013]]\n\n\n== ## bNote-2013-09-12 ==\n\n* [[Industry intelligence]]\n\n== ## bNote-2013-09-11 ==\n\n* http://admission.snu.ac.kr/graduate\n: 지원서 접수 마감: 2013-10-18 18:00 \n: TOEFL (CBT / IBT / PBT : 227 / 86 / 567)\n\n* [[Workload analysis-driven system architecture design]]\n\n== ## bNote-2013-09-10 ==\n\n=== Preparing Talk 2013-09-11 ===\n\n* SHOULD get focused!!!\n: separate topics to be discussed from topics to hide (no need to mention)\n\n* Research goal\n: Devise distinguished approaches which leads to the fundamental change in the\ndistributed computing paradigm\n\n* History and future direction based on the map of \'time/area axes\'\n:- to show the direction and motivation\n:- to reveal all the topics connected organically\n:- to reveal the real capability (programming, patents, papers, ...)\n\n* Capability: programming\n:- R, Python, and shell for analysis (esp. list familiar R packages)\n::- R statistical computing framework (frequent itemset mining, association rules mining, HMM, neuralnet)\n:- C and Assembly reading for kernel development\n::- Fusion IO VSL (virtualized storage layer) analysis\n\n* Capability: standardization experience\n:- LiMo Security TF: SPEF (Security policy enforcement framework) with Motorola\n:- Good technical communication\n\n* Patents portfolio\n:- List up all the patents to reveal the technical experience\n:- Strategic patents\n\n* Paper portfolio\n:- List up all the papers to reveal the technical experience\n\n* Study plan - Virtualization, Hadoop, ARM, Workload Analysis\n: Green computing\n: Profiling\n: Bottleneck analysis\n\n\n=== Note ===\n\n----\n\n* VDI VM data backup\n\n* VDI VM access (F:)\n: \\\\75.1.240.249\\SAIT$\\brian.m.jung\n:: Microsoft Windows Network\n\n* VDI VM access (R:)\n: \\\\75.1.240.244\\sharesait72$\n:: Microsoft Windows Network\n\n <pre>\n\n# Architect // 3.27 GB\n# atlas // 13.9 GB\n# FutureOS // 6.35 GB\n~ gto // 7.11 GB\n~ Multicore // 7.27 GB\nosv // 64.9 GB\nosv/__SW_Mobility // 29.4 GB\nosv_sds // 16.0 GB\nse기획_ok // 24.8 GB\nStorage // \n~ swgto // 3.60 GB\n~ sw역량강화 // 2.27 GB\n~ 인적역량wg // 0.0503 GB\n\n</pre>\n\n* VDI VM access (--)\n: \\\\168.219.177.80\\종기원\n:: Microsoft Windows Network\n\n\n----\n\n연락처, 전화번호\n구본철 010-9190-5907 01091905907\n신현정 017-324-9294 0173249294\n\n----\n\n== ## bNote-2013-09-09 ==\n\n=== Micro server ===\n\n* http://armservers.com/2012/11/16/whats-a-little-core-like-arm-doing-in-a-place-like-this/#more-452\n\n* SeaMicro Vs.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1552,'<!--\nhttp://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n-->\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1556,'<!--\nhttp://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n-->\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1557,'<!--\nhttp://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n-->\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1558,'<!--\nhttp://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n-->\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1559,'<!--\nhttp://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n-->\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1560,'<!--\nhttp://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n-->\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced.

OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1563,'<!--\nhttp://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n-->\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced.

Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1577,'<!--\nhttp://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n-->\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1578,'<!--\nhttp://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n-->\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced.

I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced.

(Update: Hynix acquired LAMD for $248 million.) LAMD was actually founded over eight years ago, but it has not received much publicity until earlier this month when Corsair announced their Neutron SSD series, which is the first consumer SSD to be based on a LAMD controller. LAMD has been more concentrated on the enterprise storage market in the past.</ref>\n|-\n| 2012-06 || SanDisk || Schooner Information Technology || Storage HW\n|-\n| 2012-06 || BitMicro Networks || QualCore || NAND Flash Controller\n|-\n| 2012-05 || EMC || XtremIO || Storage HW\n|-\n| 2012-02 || SanDisk || FlashSoft || SSD Cache SW || Sunnyvale, CA 출신의 SSD Cache SW 업체인 FlashSoft를 SanDisk가 인수.

This agreement would enable a combination of enterprise technology solutions that have the opportunity to virtualize SSD storage on the path to a \'\'\'more flexible and dynamic data center\'\'\'.\" That\'s the key. A bunch of Micron SSDs could be shared by servers and form a subsidiary tier of memory. Software will be needed to populate the SSDs with data and farm out their capacity to servers in some optimised way. \'\'\'Fusion-io\'\'\' has its ioTurbine caching software to do this, but only on a per-server basis, and \'\'\'Dell\'\'\' is working with its RNA software on server flash storage. \'\'\'OCZ\'\'\' has acquired SANRAD for its server flash caching functionality.</ref> <ref>[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/01/23/virtensys_crash/ Micron bought the ashes of crashed Virtensys (The Register, 2012-01-23)]<br/>PCIe sharing 기술을 통해 HBA 혹은 NIC 장비를 server간 공유시킨다는 아이디어를 기반으로, Xyratex 출신인 Marek Piekarski가 2005년에 Manchester, UK에서 VirtenSys 설립 (이를 통해, 모든 server들이 전부 HBA/NIC을 가지고 있지 않아도 되고, 공유되는 HBA/NIC의 utilization/optimization rate을 높일 수 있게 됨). 가상화된 server들이 증가하면서, 각 server들이 NICs, HBAs에 IO 부담이 가중되기 시작하고 VirtenSys의 아이디어가 큰 관심을 끌게 되었음. 그러나, Data Center의 server IO 동작 방식을 바꾼다는 것이 쉽지 않았으며, Xsigo와의 제품 비교에서도 뒤쳐지는 등, 기술적 뿐만 아니라 기술외적인 어려움을 겪으면서 투자받은 금액을 소진하게 되었음.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant Technology || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1581,'<!--\nhttp://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n-->\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced.

(Kaminario에서는 이것을 3D performance라고 부르고 있음)\n\n* Scalability\n: K2는 성능과 용량을 linear하게 scale하는 것이 쉽게 가능하도록 구현되어있음. (node scaling을 하더라도 0.3msec 미만의 수준으로 latency가 유지된다고 함)\n\n* Resiliency\n: K2의 HW component들은 모두 redundant 하며 single point of failure가 없도록 함으로써 high availability를 달성. Kaminario의 built-in failover and recovery 기능으로 인해 시스템 failure 상황에서도 성능 저하 수준이 25% 이하가 되도록 하고 있음. System SW upgrade는 non-disruptive 방식으로 이루어지기 때문에 system 사용성에 중단이 업도록 하고 있음. 또한 모든 HW component들은 hot-swappable함. System failure 시에는 자동으로 system 관리자에게 알리고, 그동안 internal backup flash로부터 data를 access하도록 조치됨.\n\n* Manageability\n: 특별한 이야기는 없음.\n\n(그런데 이 모든 것들을 가능케 하는 구체적 메커니즘은?)\n\n\n==== SPC-1 benchmark for K2-D product ====\n\nSolid state storage supplier Kaminario has grabbed the SPC-1 storage benchmark with the first million-plus IOPS score, a full 134 per cent faster than previous king-of-the-heap IBM.\n\nKaminario provides a \'\'\'K2 line of clusterable solid state storage systems\'\'\' using \'\'\'DRAM (K2-D)\'\'\', \'\'\'NAND (K2-F) with Fusion-io PCIe flash cards\'\'\', or \'\'\'a hybrid DRAM-NAND system (K2-H)\'\'\'.

For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant Technology || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1585,'<!--\nhttp://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n-->\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

(node scaling을 하더라도 0.3msec 미만의 수준으로 latency가 유지된다고 함)\n\n* Resiliency\n: K2의 HW component들은 모두 redundant 하며 single point of failure가 없도록 함으로써 high availability를 달성. Kaminario의 built-in failover and recovery 기능으로 인해 시스템 failure 상황에서도 성능 저하 수준이 25% 이하가 되도록 하고 있음. System SW upgrade는 non-disruptive 방식으로 이루어지기 때문에 system 사용성에 중단이 업도록 하고 있음. 또한 모든 HW component들은 hot-swappable함. System failure 시에는 자동으로 system 관리자에게 알리고, 그동안 internal backup flash로부터 data를 access하도록 조치됨.\n\n* Manageability\n: 특별한 이야기는 없음.\n\n(그런데 이 모든 것들을 가능케 하는 구체적 메커니즘은?)\n\n==== SPC-1 benchmark for K2-D product ====\n\nSolid state storage supplier Kaminario has grabbed the SPC-1 storage benchmark with the first million-plus IOPS score, a full 134 per cent faster than previous king-of-the-heap IBM.\n\nKaminario provides a \'\'\'K2 line of clusterable solid state storage systems\'\'\' using \'\'\'DRAM (K2-D)\'\'\', \'\'\'NAND (K2-F) with Fusion-io PCIe flash cards\'\'\', or \'\'\'a hybrid DRAM-NAND system (K2-H)\'\'\'.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1586,'<!--\nhttp://www.bloter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Table_Flash_MNA_List-1H13_thumb-500x378.png\n<ref>[주간스토리지] 새로운 플래시 기술 ‘NVMe’ http://www.bloter.net/archives/163450</ref>\n-->\n\n\n== Big & Medium Players ==\n\n\n=== EMC ===\n\n=== Fusion IO (PCIe SSD) ===\n\nFusion-io is a leading provider of enterprise solid-state technology and high-performance I/O solutions that unlock a world of possibilities for performance-starved applications, closing the gap between processing power and storage performance. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fusion-io Fusion-io - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== Intel ===\n\n=== LSI ===\n\n\n=== Micron (DRAM, NAND Flash) ===\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron manufactures DRAM components and modules and NAND Flash. <ref>[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/micron-technology Micron Technology - CrunchBase Profile]</ref>\n\n=== NetApp ===\n\n=== OCZ ===\n\n\n=== SanDisk (NAND Flash) ===\n\n=== SeaGate ===\n\n\n=== SK Hynix (DRAM, NAND Flash, System IC) ===\n\nSK Hynix is the global leader in producing semiconductor, such as DRAM and NAND flash and System IC including CMOS Image Sensors.

(Update: Hynix acquired LAMD for $248 million.) LAMD was actually founded over eight years ago, but it has not received much publicity until earlier this month when Corsair announced their Neutron SSD series, which is the first consumer SSD to be based on a LAMD controller. LAMD has been more concentrated on the enterprise storage market in the past.</ref>\n|-\n| 2012-06 || SanDisk || Schooner Information Technology || Storage HW\n|-\n| 2012-06 || BitMicro Networks || QualCore || NAND Flash Controller\n|-\n| 2012-05 || EMC || XtremIO || Storage HW\n|-\n| 2012-02 || SanDisk || FlashSoft || SSD Cache SW || Sunnyvale, CA 출신의 SSD Cache SW 업체인 FlashSoft를 SanDisk가 인수.

Micron이 어떤 기술을 확보했는지의 의미도 중요하지만, VirtenSys가 끝내 이륙하지 못하고 crash될 수 밖에 없었던 배경을 이해하는 것도 중요.<ref>[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/01/20/micron_buys_virtensys/ Micron buys PCIe extender Virtensys, backers trouser hefty payout (The Register, 2012-01-20)]<br/>(VirtenSys를 인수한 Micron의 의도) Edward Doller, Micron VP and Chief Memory Systems Architect, said: \"Virtensys\' PCIe-sharing technology has helped change the way data center operators manage and deploy their virtualized I/O resources, and Micron\'s enterprise PCIe drive delivers market-leading speed, reliability and power efficiency. This agreement would enable a combination of enterprise technology solutions that have the opportunity to virtualize SSD storage on the path to a \'\'\'more flexible and dynamic data center\'\'\'.\" That\'s the key. A bunch of Micron SSDs could be shared by servers and form a subsidiary tier of memory. Software will be needed to populate the SSDs with data and farm out their capacity to servers in some optimised way. \'\'\'Fusion-io\'\'\' has its ioTurbine caching software to do this, but only on a per-server basis, and \'\'\'Dell\'\'\' is working with its RNA software on server flash storage. \'\'\'OCZ\'\'\' has acquired SANRAD for its server flash caching functionality.</ref> <ref>[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/01/23/virtensys_crash/ Micron bought the ashes of crashed Virtensys (The Register, 2012-01-23)]<br/>PCIe sharing 기술을 통해 HBA 혹은 NIC 장비를 server간 공유시킨다는 아이디어를 기반으로, Xyratex 출신인 Marek Piekarski가 2005년에 Manchester, UK에서 VirtenSys 설립 (이를 통해, 모든 server들이 전부 HBA/NIC을 가지고 있지 않아도 되고, 공유되는 HBA/NIC의 utilization/optimization rate을 높일 수 있게 됨). 가상화된 server들이 증가하면서, 각 server들이 NICs, HBAs에 IO 부담이 가중되기 시작하고 VirtenSys의 아이디어가 큰 관심을 끌게 되었음. 그러나, Data Center의 server IO 동작 방식을 바꾼다는 것이 쉽지 않았으며, Xsigo와의 제품 비교에서도 뒤쳐지는 등, 기술적 뿐만 아니라 기술외적인 어려움을 겪으면서 투자받은 금액을 소진하게 되었음. Micron이 VirtenSys 인수에 얼마의 금액을 썼는지는 비밀로 부쳐졌으나, 대략 $160M (약 1600억원) 정도일 것으로 추정됨.</ref>\n|-\n| 2012-01 || OCZ || SANRAD || SSD Caching, Virtualization SW || 이스라엘 기반의 flash caching 및 virtualization SW/HW 업체인 SANRAD를 OCZ가 $15M (약 150억원)에 인수. 이를 통해 VMware와 Citrix Xen 가상화 환경에서의 PCIe SSD 솔루션 적용 확대 모색.<ref>[http://www.storagereview.com/ocz_acquires_sanrad OCZ Acquires SANRAD (2012-01-09)]<br/>OCZ Technology has announced the acquisition of SANRAD Inc., an Israel-based provider of flash caching and virtualization software and hardware. The addition of this intellectual property to OCZ\'s portfolio is expected to increase the adoption of PCIe SSD storage solutions specifically in VMware and Citrix Xen environments. SANRAD currently sells its flash caching and virtualization software to OEMs like NEXSAN and Brocade.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant Technology || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8');

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced.

It needed a partner that would bring sound validation methodology and the resources to actually test SF drives. I mentioned to many players in the SSD and HDD space that they should simply buy SandForce and make this easier on everyone. Today LSI announced that it would be the company to try and do just that. Pending the typical closing conditions and regulatory approvals, LSI will acquire SandForce for $322M in cash plus assume another $48M in unvested SF stock options. LSI isn\'t much of a player in the consumer space but it hopes to use SandForce\'s controllers in a go at the enterprise market. A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it.

To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced.

(Kaminario에서는 이것을 3D performance라고 부르고 있음)\n\n* Scalability\n: K2는 성능과 용량을 linear하게 scale하는 것이 쉽게 가능하도록 구현되어있음. (node scaling을 하더라도 0.3msec 미만의 수준으로 latency가 유지된다고 함)\n\n* Resiliency\n: K2의 HW component들은 모두 redundant 하며 single point of failure가 없도록 함으로써 high availability를 달성. Kaminario의 built-in failover and recovery 기능으로 인해 시스템 failure 상황에서도 성능 저하 수준이 25% 이하가 되도록 하고 있음. System SW upgrade는 non-disruptive 방식으로 이루어지기 때문에 system 사용성에 중단이 업도록 하고 있음. 또한 모든 HW component들은 hot-swappable함. System failure 시에는 자동으로 system 관리자에게 알리고, 그동안 internal backup flash로부터 data를 access하도록 조치됨.\n\n* Manageability\n: 특별한 이야기는 없음.\n\n(그런데 이 모든 것들을 가능케 하는 구체적 메커니즘은?)\n\n==== SPC-1 benchmark for K2-D product ====\n\nSolid state storage supplier Kaminario has grabbed the SPC-1 storage benchmark with the first million-plus IOPS score, a full 134 per cent faster than previous king-of-the-heap IBM.\n\nKaminario provides a \'\'\'K2 line of clusterable solid state storage systems\'\'\' using \'\'\'DRAM (K2-D)\'\'\', \'\'\'NAND (K2-F) with Fusion-io PCIe flash cards\'\'\', or \'\'\'a hybrid DRAM-NAND system (K2-H)\'\'\'.

A look back at the Vertex 3 in our Intel SSD 710 review shows just how strong SandForce\'s architecture can be in database server workloads. As I\'ve written before, the enterprise space is where the high margin sales are and as a result many players in the SSD space are focusing on it. For now don\'t expect anything to change with regards to SF drives in the client space, but OCZ\'s timing with Octane probably couldn\'t have been any better. <br/><img src=\"http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5017/sf-2000.jpg\"/></ref>\n|-\n| 2011-05-16 || SanDisk || Pliant Technology || Storage HW || SanDisk가 Pliant Technology를 $327M (약 3,500억원)에 인수.

Under the terms of the agreement, SanDisk will pay approximately $327 million in cash and provide certain equity-based incentives. Pliant Technology offers SSDs that integrate into enterprise information systems. The company has approximately 80 employees and is based in Milpitas, California. The company raised over $50 million since its founding in 2006.</ref>\n|-\n| 2011-04-20 || STEC || KQ Infotech || ?? || sTec은 system SW 개발 및 가상화 기술 역량 강화를 위해 KQ Infotech의 핵심 멤버 30명을 흡수. <ref>[http://www.storagenewsletter.com/news/business/stec-acquires-assets-of-kq-infotech Stec Acquires Assets of KQ Infotech (2011-04-20)] <br/>The portfolio of acquired assets includes KQI\'s intellectual property rights. In addition, STEC has hired approximately 30 key employees of KQI to augment its existing software development team. The financial terms of this transaction are not disclosed. \"The team of skilled software engineers from KQI has significant experience in such areas as \'\'\'system software development and virtualization\'\'\',\" said CEO of sTec.</ref>\n|-\n| 2011-03 || OCZ || Indilinx || NAND Flash Controllers || OCZ는 SandForce Controller의 Retail/Channel로 역할을 하고 있었지만, SandForce는  OCZ 뿐만 아니라 OCZ의 경쟁자들에게도 Controller를 판매하고 있었음. 이에 대한 위기 의식으로, 이전부터 밀접한 관계를 가져오던 Indilinx를 인수한 것으로 보이며, 이로 인해 OCZ는 SandForce SSD Controller 의존도를 낮추고 자립성을 높일 수 있게 됨. <ref>[http://www.anandtech.com/show/4220/ocz-grows-up-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-indilinx OCZ Grows Up, Signs Definitive Agreement to Acquire Indilinx (2011-03-14)]<br/>Why would OCZ acquire Indilinx? To be honest, it\'s the only way to ensure growth in the future. While OCZ is currently the retail/channel face of SandForce, SF also happens to sell to all of OCZ\'s competitors. OCZ may get early access to SandForce hardware, but so could anyone else who shows up with a big enough check. Ultimately to stick around in this business OCZ needs to be able to build its own controller and that\'s what the Indilinx acquisition is designed to allow. Indilinx was working on its first 6Gbps controller codenamed Jet Stream, however the design never surfaced. Delays do happen in chip design and I\'m guessing Indilinx just couldn\'t make it happen with Jet Stream.</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>','utf-8'),(1591,'\n== Introduction (v1.0) ==\n\n=== 관심 연구 주제 ===\n\n <pre>\n(a) Large-scale 분석 응용에 대한 I/O Workload 이해/예측\n     : Hadoop 혹은 HPC Cluster 상의 분석 응용들을 타겟으로 하고 있습니다.\n(b) ARM 기반의 고성능/저전력 분산 Converged System 설계/검증\n     : (a)를 통해 얻은 Insight을 (b) 연구에 활용할 계획입니다.\n\n참고로, 위의 주제는 삼성의 Device Solution 부문 차원에서\n큰 관심을 가지고 새롭게 연구하려는 분야이며,\n학교 연구실과도 적극적인 협력을 통해 연구의 시너지를 도모하려 하고 있습니다.\n</pre>\n\n=== Work experience ===\n\n<!--\n <pre>\n저는 경북대학교 전자공학과를 97년에 졸업하였으며,\n동 대학원에서 석사과정 동안 암호학을 전공하였습니다.\n</pre>\n-->\n\n <pre>\n저의 기술/연구분야는 다음 4개로 요약할 수 있습니다.\n\n- Security (DRM, Trusted Computing) (\'97~\'07)\n  : Mandatory Access Control 연구 (Motorola와 함께 LiMo 표준에 반영)\n  : Platform Integrity Measurement 연구 (ACM SACMAT \'08)\n\n- Virtualization/OS (\'08~계속)\n  : Xen-ARM Hypervisor에서의 Access Control 연구 (MobiCom \'09)\n  : Fast Linux Boot, Device 간 OS State Migration 연구 (사업부에 기술 이전)\n\n- (Distributed) Storage System (\'11~계속)\n  : Enterprise Storage 성능 향상을 위한\n    Intelligent Block Caching / Automatic Storage Tiering 기술 (진행 중)\n\n- Data Analysis (\'12~계속)\n  : Hadoop, VDI 시스템에서의 I/O Workload Analysis 연구 (진행 중)\n</pre>\n\n\n\n\n== Introduction (v1.1) ==\n\n=== 관심 연구 주제 ===\n\n <pre>\n(a) Large-scale 분석 응용에 대한 I/O Workload 이해/예측\n     : Hadoop 혹은 HPC Cluster 상의 분석 응용들을 타겟으로 하고 있습니다.\n(b) ARM 기반의 고성능/저전력 분산 Converged System 설계/검증\n     : (a)를 통해 얻은 Insight을 (b) 연구에 활용할 계획입니다.\n\n참고로, 위의 주제는 삼성의 Device Solution 부문 차원에서\n큰 관심을 가지고 새롭게 연구하려는 분야이며,\n학교 연구실과도 적극적인 협력을 통해 연구의 시너지를 도모하려 하고 있습니다.\n</pre>\n\n=== Work experience ===\n\n<!--\n <pre>\n저는 경북대학교 전자공학과를 97년에 졸업하였으며,\n동 대학원에서 석사과정 동안 암호학을 전공하였습니다.\n</pre>\n-->\n\n <pre>\n저의 기술/연구분야는 다음 4개로 요약할 수 있습니다.\n\n- Security (DRM, Trusted Computing) (\'97~\'07)\n  : Mandatory Access Control 연구 (Motorola와 함께 LiMo 표준에 반영)\n  : Platform Integrity Measurement 연구 (ACM SACMAT \'08)\n\n- Virtualization/OS (\'08~계속)\n  : Xen-ARM Hypervisor에서의 Access Control 연구 (MobiCom \'09)\n  : Fast Linux Boot, Device 간 OS State Migration 연구 (사업부에 기술 이전)\n\n- (Distributed) Storage System (\'11~계속)\n  : Enterprise Storage 성능 향상을 위한\n    Intelligent Block Caching / Automatic Storage Tiering 기술 (진행 중)\n\n- Data Analysis (\'12~계속)\n  : Hadoop, VDI 시스템에서의 I/O Workload Analysis 연구 (진행 중)\n</pre>\n\n== Questions ==\n\n* 고성능/저전력 분산 Converged System 설계 시 x86 기반 접근에 비해 ARM 기반 접근 시 특별히 고려해야 할 부분은 어떤 것이 있는가?\n\n\n== Technologies ==\n\n\n=== Data center architecture ===\n\n* OpenStack\n:- Compute (Nova)\n:- Object Storage (Swift)\n:- Block Storage (Cinder)\n:- Networking (Neutron)\n:- Dashboard (Horizon)\n:- Identity Service (Keystone)\n:- Image Service (Glance)\n\n\n=== Virtualization ===\n\n* http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Virtualization_Spectrum\n\n* http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Scheduling_in_Xen\n\n* http://www.virtualizationmatrix.com/matrix.php\n: Virtualization matrix -
